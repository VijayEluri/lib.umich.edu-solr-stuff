= COMPILING THE SOURCE

The easiest way to use the solr filters  here is to just put the whole _umichnormalizers_ tree into your _solr/contrib_ directory. It should automatically build when you build solr, producing a .jar file in the _target_ directory.

See the wiki pages at [http://wiki.github.com/billdueber/lib.umich.edu-solr-stuff](http://wiki.github.com/billdueber/lib.umich.edu-solr-stuff) for information on how to use these methods.
